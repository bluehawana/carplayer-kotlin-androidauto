# 🔧 Car Player Channel Diagnostics

## 🚀 HYBRID PLAYER ENGINE (Industry Best Practice):

### 1. **DUAL ENGINE SYSTEM (Like TiviMate/IPTV Smarters)**
- **ExoPlayer PRIMARY**: Google's recommended player (better Android sync)
- **VLC FALLBACK**: Automatic fallback for problematic streams
- **Smart Engine Switching**: Auto-detects issues and switches engines
- **Manual Override**: 📺 button to manually switch engines

### 2. **Channel Switching Fixed**
- Added proper cleanup between channel switches
- Increased switch delay from 500ms to 1000ms
- Added view detachment/reattachment for clean transitions

### 3. **AUDIO CODEC FIXES (Garbled Audio Fix)**
- Comprehensive audio codec support (AAC, MP3, AC3, etc.)
- High-quality audio resampling (SOXR)
- Volume normalization for consistent audio
- Audio track switching for multi-language channels
- NEW: 🔊 AUDIO button to fix garbled voices

### 4. **Enhanced Buffering Display**
- Shows buffering percentage during loading
- Auto-restart for interrupted IPTV streams
- Better error messages with Nordic theme
- Audio track information display

### 5. **IPTV Stream Optimizations**
- Better user agent for compatibility
- TCP mode for RTSP streams
- Network synchronization enabled
- Multi-threading for smooth playback
- Experimental codec support enabled

## 🧪 Testing Your Channels:

### **Recommended Test Order:**
1. **News Channels** (usually most stable):
   - CNN, BBC, Fox News, Al Jazeera

2. **Sports Channels** (good for testing sync):
   - Sky Sports F1, NBC Sports, Fox Sports

3. **Movies** (test for quality):
   - HBO, Cinemax, Sky Cinema

### **What to Look For NOW:**
- ✅ **BETTER SYNC**: Audio should match video timing (no fast/slow voices)
- ✅ **NO JUMPING**: Content should play smoothly without frame jumps
- ✅ **Moderate Loading**: Channels take 4-6 seconds to start (building sync buffer)
- ✅ **Consistent Speed**: Audio and video at same speed (like BBC)
- ✅ **Smooth Switching**: No errors when changing channels

### **If You Still Have Issues:**
1. **Tap screen** to show controls
2. **Try NEXT channel** if current one has problems
3. **Use network test** in main menu
4. **Check your internet speed** (IPTV needs 5+ Mbps)

## 📊 Your Channel Categories:
- **News** (6 channels): CNN, BBC, Fox News, Al Jazeera, etc.
- **Sports** (13 channels): Sky Sports, NBC Sports, Fox Sports, etc.
- **Movies** (7 channels): HBO, Cinemax, Sky Cinema, etc.

## 📺 Player Engine Switching:
If you have sync/audio/video issues:

3. **ExoPlayer**: Better sync, less buffering issues
4. **VLC**: Better codec support, handles unusual streams
5. **Auto-fallback**: System automatically tries VLC if ExoPlayer fails

## 🎯 Which Engine to Use:
- **📺 EXO**: Try first - better for most channels (BBC, CNN, Sky Sports)
- **📺 VLC**: Use for problematic streams with codec issues
- **Auto-switch**: Let the system decide (recommended)

The Nordic Ice Age theme should make everything look cool while you test! ❄️

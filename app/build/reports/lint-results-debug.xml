        id="LintBaseline"
        severity="Hint"
        message="5 errors and 109 warnings were filtered out because they are listed in the baseline file, lint-baseline.xml"
        category="Lint"
        priority="10"
        summary="Baseline Applied"
        explanation="Lint can be configured with a &quot;baseline&quot;; a set of current issues found in a codebase, which future runs of lint will silently ignore. Only new issues not found in the baseline are reported.&#xA;&#xA;Note that while opening files in the IDE, baseline issues are not filtered out; the purpose of baselines is to allow you to get started using lint and break the build on all newly introduced errors, without having to go back and fix the entire codebase up front. However, when you open up existing files you still want to be aware of and fix issues as you come across them.&#xA;&#xA;This issue type is used to emit an informational-only warning if any issues were filtered out due to baseline matching. That way, you don&apos;t have a false sense of security if you forgot that you&apos;ve checked in a baseline file.">

    <issue
        id="LintBaselineFixed"
        severity="Hint"
        message="16 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with `android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true`. Unmatched issue types: SetTextI18n (2), UnsafeOptInUsageError (12), UseKtx (2)"
        category="Lint"
        priority="10"
        summary="Baselined Issues Fixed"
        explanation="If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)">

        severity="Warning"
        message="The native library `arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so` (from `org.videolan.android:libvlc-all:3.5.1`) is not 16 KB aligned"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="2"
        summary="Native library dependency not 16 KB aligned"
        explanation="Android has traditionally used 4 KB memory page sizes. However, to support future devices that only work with 16 KB aligned libraries apps containing native libraries need to be built with 16 KB alignment.&#xA;&#xA;Apps with 4 KB aligned native libraries may not work correctly on devices requiring 16 KB alignment. To ensure compatibility and future-proof your app, it is strongly recommended that your native libraries are aligned to 16 KB boundaries.&#xA;&#xA;If your app uses any NDK libraries, directly or indirectly through an SDK, you should rebuild your app to meet this recommendation. Make sure all native libraries within your application, including those from dependencies, are built with 16 KB page alignment.&#xA;&#xA;This lint check looks at all native libraries that your app depends on. If any are found to be aligned to 4 KB instead of 16 KB, you will need to address this.&#xA;&#xA;When a library is flagged, first try to update to a newer version that supports 16 KB alignment. If an updated version is not available, contact the library vendor to ask about their plans for 16 KB support and request a compatible version. Updating your libraries proactively will help ensure your app works properly on a wider range of devices."

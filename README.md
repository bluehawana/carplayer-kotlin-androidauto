            response.channels.map { apiChannel ->
                Channel(
                    id = apiChannel.id,
                    name = apiChannel.name,
                    description = apiChannel.description,
                    streamUrl = apiChannel.streamUrl,
                    logoUrl = apiChannel.logoUrl,
                    category = apiChannel.category,
                    isHD = apiChannel.isHD
                )
            }

## üì± Network Optimization

### Automatic Network Detection

The app intelligently detects and optimizes for different network types:

- **üì∂ WiFi**: Standard quality, minimal buffering
- **üì± Cellular Hotspot**: Extended buffering, channel preloading
- **üöÄ 5G (Comviq/Tele2)**: High-quality streaming with adaptive bitrate
- **üêå Poor Connection**: Conservative settings, VLC fallback engine

### Smart Features for Cellular Users

- **Hotspot Detection**: Automatically detects when using phone hotspot
- **Channel Preloading**: Tests next 3 channels in background for instant switching
- **Connection Quality Indicators**:

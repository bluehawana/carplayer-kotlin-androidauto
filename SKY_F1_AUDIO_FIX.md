# Sky Sports F1 Audio Fix Implementation

## Problem
Sky Sports F1 streams had no audio in the car player app, while working perfectly in other IPTV players like APTV, TiviMate, OTT, and IPTV Smarters.

## Root Cause
The app was trying to use a non-existent `ExoPlayerController` and falling back to VLC with suboptimal settings for IPTV audio streams.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Hybrid Media Controller Architecture
Created a **dual-engine approach** (like successful IPTV players):
- **Primary Engine**: ExoPlayer (better Android integration, audio sync)
- **Fallback Engine**: VLC (better codec support for unusual formats)

### 2. ExoPlayer Optimizations for IPTV
```kotlin
// Audio attributes for better audio handling
setAudioAttributes(
    AudioAttributes.Builder()
        .setUsage(C.USAGE_MEDIA)
        .setContentType(C.AUDIO_CONTENT_TYPE_MOVIE)
        .build(),
    true // Handle audio focus
)
```

### 3. Sky Sports F1 Specific Optimizations
- **User Agent**: Uses Mozilla/5.0 for Sky streams (better compatibility)
- **HLS Media Source**: Optimized for .m3u8 streams
- **Connection Timeouts**: 10 second timeouts for stability
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects Sky F1 streams and applies optimizations

### 4. User Controls Added
- **ðŸŽµ VLC/EXO Button**: Switch between engines on-the-fly
- **ðŸ”„ RESTART Button**: Restart with current engine
- **Real-time Engine Display**: Shows which engine is active

## How It Works

### Automatic Engine Selection
1. **ExoPlayer First**: Tries ExoPlayer for all streams (better for most IPTV)
2. **Auto-Fallback**: If ExoPlayer fails, automatically switches to VLC
3. **Sky F1 Detection**: Special handling for Sky Sports F1 streams

### Manual Engine Switching
Users can manually switch engines if they experience issues:
- Tap screen to show controls
- Tap **ðŸŽµ VLC** or **ðŸŽµ EXO** to switch engines
- Engine switches with proper cleanup and restart

### Error Handling
- **Network Issues**: Clear error messages with retry logic
- **Format Issues**: Automatic fallback to VLC for unsupported formats
- **Audio Sync**: ExoPlayer handles audio sync better than VLC on Android

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `ExoPlayerController.kt` - Primary media engine
- `HybridMediaController.kt` - Dual-engine controller
- `SKY_F1_AUDIO_FIX.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `VideoPlayerActivity.kt` - Updated to use HybridMediaController
- Added engine switching controls and Sky F1 optimizations

## Testing Instructions

1. **Launch App**: Open the car player app on emulator
2. **Play Sky F1**: Navigate to Sky Sports F1 channel
3. **Check Audio**: Should now have audio with ExoPlayer
4. **Test Switching**: Use ðŸŽµ button to switch between engines
5. **Test Other Channels**: Verify other channels still work

## Expected Results

- âœ… **Sky Sports F1**: Now has audio (using ExoPlayer optimizations)
- âœ… **Other Channels**: Continue working as before
- âœ… **Fallback Support**: VLC available for problematic streams
- âœ… **User Control**: Manual engine switching available
- âœ… **Better Performance**: ExoPlayer provides better sync and integration

## Technical Benefits

1. **Industry Standard**: Uses same approach as TiviMate, IPTV Smarters
2. **Reliability**: Dual-engine fallback prevents total failures
3. **Performance**: ExoPlayer optimized for Android automotive
4. **Flexibility**: Users can choose engine based on stream quality
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more engines or optimizations

This implementation follows IPTV industry best practices and should resolve the Sky Sports F1 audio issues while maintaining compatibility with all other channels.
